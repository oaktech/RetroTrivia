# RetroTrivia — Feature Ideas

## 🔥 High Impact / Retention

**Daily Challenge**
A new question set every day with a streak counter. Streaks are one of the strongest retention mechanics (see Duolingo).

**Leaderboard**
GameKit/Game Center integration — global and friends-only rankings. Competitive players share apps.

**Achievements & Badges**
"Answer 10 in a row", "80s Expert", "Night Owl" (played after midnight). Drives long-term engagement.

**Lives System**
Give players 3 lives per run. Wrong answers cost a life — adds stakes and encourages replays.

## 🎮 Gameplay Depth

**Timed Mode**
A countdown per question (10-15 sec). Adds pressure and replayability.

**Decade Selector**
Expand beyond 80s — let players choose 70s, 90s, 00s. Widens the audience significantly.

**Category Deep Dives**
Filter by genre (Rock, Pop, Hip-Hop, R&B) or artist. Niche audiences are passionate.

**Multiplayer Pass-and-Play**
Two players, same device, taking turns. Zero infrastructure needed, huge party appeal.

**Hint System**
"50/50" or "Skip" consumables — classic trivia mechanic players expect.

"Disco Pack", "Hair Metal Pack", "One-Hit Wonders Pack" as one-time IAP.

## ✨ Polish

**Animated Map Characters**
A small retro avatar that walks up/down the map instead of just highlighting a circle.
